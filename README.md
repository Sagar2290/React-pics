## Getting Started

This app is a practice project to understand use of hooks, data fetching and state management.

For this app I have used axios as data fetching tool and image unsplash for fetching the set of images as per users search term.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
